        "1) **Dataset**: A Dataset in PyTorch represents a collection of data. It could be in-memory data like a list of Python objects or out-of-memory data like images on a disk. The Dataset class provides a standardized way to access this data. You typically subclass the Dataset class and implement the `__getitem__` and `__len__` methods to return a single data item and the size of the dataset, respectively. PyTorch also provides several pre-defined Dataset classes like ImageFolder for common use-cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **DataLoader**: While the Dataset class provides a way to access individual data items, the DataLoader class provides a way to iterate over a Dataset in batches. This is important because when training a neural network, you typically don't feed in the entire dataset at once but process it in smaller batches. The DataLoader also makes it easy to shuffle the data and use multiple subprocesses to load the data in parallel.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Top-5** - If one of the model’s top 5 highest probability predictions match the ground truth. If it does, you count it as a correct prediction. It answers the question, \"How often is the correct class within the top 5 guesses of the model?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy is often used for tasks where the exact prediction is crucial. Top-5 Accuracy is more common in scenario where there may be ambiguity, and being close to the correct answer is still valuable.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Optional, but good to know parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "### `optimizer_params` - The parameters of the optimizer you're using, leaving it blank will use defaults\n",
        "\n",
        "[For example, there are the parameters for Adam](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html#torch.optim.Adam)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### `criterion_params` - Activates label smoothing cross entropy\n",
        "\n",
        "In the regular cross entropy loss, we're very strict about our labels: the correct class has a value of 1, and all other classes have a value of 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "But this can sometimes lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too confident about its predictions and performs poorly on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Label smoothing cross-entropy builds upon regular cross-entropy by adding a touch of \"softness\" to the labels, leading to a model that's confident but not excessively so.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Label Smoothing Cross-Entropy**: Instead of using strict 0s and 1s in the true labels, label smoothing uses slightly \"softer\" values (e.g., [0.9, 0.05, 0.05] for class 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Improvement:\n",
        " - **Avoiding Overconfidence:** It prevents the model from becoming overly confident about its predictions. It acts as a form of regularization that can improve generalization to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Stability in Training:** Makes the training process more stable, especially when dealing with noisy or incorrect labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Label smoothing is a simple yet effective technique to make the training process more robust and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "By softening the labels, we encourage the model to be less confident in its predictions, which can lead to better performance on unseen data. It's like telling the model, \"Be confident, but not too confident!\"\n",

        "Smoothing Factor (epsilson): This is a value between 0 and 1 that determines the degree of smoothing applied to the labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "A smoothing factor of 0 means no smoothing (i.e., traditional cross-entropy), while a value closer to 1 means more smoothing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The smoothing factor is a hyperparameter that you would typically choose based on validation performance or through hyperparameter tuning. It allows you to control how \"soft\" the labels are, providing a way to regulate the model's confidence in its predictions.\n",

        "### Learning rate scheduling parameters: `warmup_mode`, `lr_warmup_epochs`, `lr_warmup_steps`, `lr_cooldown_epochs` `warmup_initial_lr`\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning rate scheduling involves adjusting the learning rate during training. Instead of using a constant learning rate, the learning rate is changed according to a predefined schedule or rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps in finding a balance between fast convergence (using a high learning rate) and stability (using a low learning rate). Common methods include step decay, exponential decay, and cosine annealing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Warm-Up: Starts with a small learning rate and gradually increases it at the beginning of training to avoid large, unstable updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Cool-Down: Gradually reduces the learning rate towards the end of training to help the model settle into a minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning rate scheduling, including warm-up and cool-down, is generally beneficial in the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Large Datasets: These techniques help the model converge more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Deep Networks: For deep networks with many layers, controlling the learning rate prevents overshooting and helps the model reach a better minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Avoiding Overfitting: Gradually reducing the learning rate (cool-down) helps in fine-tuning the model and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Training Stability: Warm-up can prevent large updates at the beginning of training, leading to a more stable training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Exploration vs Exploitation: By controlling the learning rate, you can balance the exploration of the loss landscape (with higher learning rates) and exploitation of promising areas (with lower learning rates).\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these techniques guide the learning process, aiding in efficient and robust convergence of the model."
